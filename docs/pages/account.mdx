## Authentication

Noreva uses **wallet signature authentication** - no passwords required!

### How It Works

1. Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. **Automatic authentication** - You'll be prompted to sign immediately after connecting
3. Your wallet signs a message (this is NOT a transaction - no fees!)
4. Noreva verifies the signature to prove you own the wallet
5. You're authenticated for 24 hours

### What Authentication Enables

- **Trade History** - Your trades are saved and linked to your wallet
- **Account Settings** - Save your profile information
- **Favorites** - Your favorite stocks are saved (Note: favorites work even without authentication!)

> 🔒 **Security Note:** Signing a message is free and doesn't transfer any funds. It simply proves you own the wallet.
