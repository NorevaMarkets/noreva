# Use Cases

Practical examples of how to use Noreva for different trading strategies and goals.

## 🌙 After-Hours Trading

**Scenario:** You hear breaking news about Apple after the US market closes at 4pm ET. You want to react immediately.

### How to Trade After Hours

1. Go to [noreva.markets](https://noreva.markets)
2. Connect your Solana wallet
3. Find **AAPLx** in the stock list
4. Check the current spread (may be wider after hours)
5. Click **Buy** or **Sell** based on the news
6. Confirm in your wallet

> 💡 **Tip:** Spreads typically widen after market hours due to reduced liquidity. Consider this in your trade sizing.

### When This Works Best

- Earnings releases (often after 4pm ET)
- Breaking news events
- Asian/European market hours
- Weekend trading

## 📈 Spread Arbitrage

**Scenario:** You notice TSLAx is trading at a -2% discount to TSLA stock. You believe this discount will close.

### How to Capture Spread

1. **Buy the discount:**
   - Purchase TSLAx at $240 when TSLA stock is at $245
   - You're getting $245 worth of exposure for $240

2. **Wait for convergence:**
   - Spreads typically return to 0-1% during market hours
   - Monitor the spread in Noreva

3. **Sell when spread normalizes:**
   - Sell TSLAx when it returns to parity
   - Profit = spread difference minus fees

### Risk Considerations

- Stock price can move against you
- Spread may widen further before converging
- Liquidity may be limited

## 📉 Hedging Crypto Positions

**Scenario:** You're bullish on crypto but want to hedge against a market downturn.

### Simple Hedge Strategy

1. **Identify your crypto exposure**

2. **Add inverse correlation**
   - Buy $2,000 of GLDx (gold)
   - Or buy $2,000 of stable stocks (KOx - Coca-Cola)

3. **Monitor correlation**
   - If crypto drops, stable assets may hold
   - Reduces overall portfolio volatility

### Using SPYx as a Hedge

SPYx (S&P 500) provides:
- Diversified US equity exposure
- Lower volatility than single stocks
- Often moves differently than crypto

   - View **Market → Earnings Calendar**

2. **Review analyst expectations:**
   - Check **Analyst Ratings** tab
   - See EPS estimates

3. **Position accordingly:**
   - Buy before if you're bullish
