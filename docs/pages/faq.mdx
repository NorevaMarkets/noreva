# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Noreva and tokenized stocks.

## General

### What is Noreva?

Noreva is a web application for tracking and trading tokenized stocks on the Solana blockchain. It aggregates data from multiple providers and enables trading via Jupiter DEX.

### What are tokenized stocks?

Tokenized stocks are blockchain tokens that represent ownership or exposure to traditional stocks. They're backed 1:1 by the underlying asset and can be traded 24/7 on decentralized exchanges.

### Who issues the tokens?

Noreva aggregates tokens from regulated providers:

- **Backed Finance** - Swiss-regulated, issues bAAPL, bMSFT, etc.
- **Swarm Markets** - German BaFin-regulated, issues SPYx, QQQx, etc.

> ℹ️ **Note:** Noreva does not issue tokens. We provide a trading interface for existing tokenized securities.

## Trading

### Can I trade 24/7?

Yes! Unlike traditional markets, tokenized stocks on Solana can be traded anytime. However, spreads may widen when traditional markets are closed due to reduced liquidity.

### What fees are there?

- **Solana network fee**: ~0.000005 SOL per transaction
- **Jupiter swap fee**: Varies by route (typically 0-0.3%)
- **Noreva fee**: None – we don't charge any fees

### What is slippage?

Slippage is the difference between the expected price and the executed price. It occurs due to price movement between quote and execution. Default is 0.5%.

### Why did my swap fail?

Common reasons:

1. **Insufficient balance** - Not enough SOL for gas or tokens for swap
2. **Slippage too low** - Price moved more than your slippage tolerance
3. **Network congestion** - Try again or increase priority fee

## Portfolio

### How do I see my holdings?

Connect your wallet and click "Portfolio" in the navigation. Your tokenized stock holdings will be automatically detected.

### Why don't I see my tokens?

Ensure:

1. You're connected with the correct wallet
2. The tokens are in your main wallet (not a token account)
3. The token has liquidity on Jupiter

### Can I import from other wallets?

Currently, Noreva shows holdings only for your connected wallet. Multi-wallet support is planned.

## Security

### Is Noreva safe?

Noreva is a non-custodial application:

- We **never** have access to your private keys
- We **never** store your funds
- All swaps happen directly on-chain via Jupiter

### Do I need to approve tokens?

No. Unlike EVM chains, Solana doesn't require token approvals. You maintain full custody at all times.

### What wallets are supported?

- Phantom (recommended)
- Solflare
- Other Solana wallets via Wallet Adapter

## Technical

### What blockchain is this on?

Solana Mainnet. Noreva uses Helius RPC for reliable blockchain access.
