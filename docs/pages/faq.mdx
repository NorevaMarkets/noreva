# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Noreva and tokenized stocks.

## General

### What is Noreva?

Noreva is a web application for tracking and trading tokenized stocks on the Solana blockchain. It aggregates data from multiple providers and enables trading via Jupiter DEX.

### What are tokenized stocks?

Tokenized stocks are blockchain tokens that represent ownership or exposure to traditional stocks. They're backed 1:1 by the underlying asset and can be traded 24/7 on decentralized exchanges.

### Who issues the tokens?

Noreva supports tokens from **Backed Finance** - a Swiss-regulated provider:

- AAPLx, TSLAx, NVDAx, MSFTx, GOOGLx, AMZNx, METAx
- SPYx, QQQx, GLDx, and more

> ℹ️ **Note:** Noreva does not issue tokens. We provide a trading interface for existing tokenized securities.

## Trading

### Where is the Trading Terminal?

Go to [noreva.markets/trade](https://noreva.markets/trade) or click "Trade" in the navigation. The Trading Terminal features:

**Desktop:**
- **Stock Sidebar** - All stocks in a collapsible left panel
- **Quick Search** - Filter by symbol or name
- **One-Click Switching** - Switch stocks without leaving the page

**Mobile:**
- **Stock Picker Dropdown** - Tap to select any stock with search
- **Chart / Info & Trade Tabs** - Switch between views
- **Fullscreen Charts** - Optimized for mobile

### Can I trade 24/7?

Yes! Unlike traditional markets, tokenized stocks on Solana can be traded anytime. However, spreads may widen when traditional markets are closed due to reduced liquidity.

### What fees are there?

- **Solana network fee**: ~0.000005 SOL per transaction
- **Jupiter swap fee**: Varies by route (typically 0-0.3%)
- **Noreva fee**: None – we don't charge any fees

### What is slippage?

Slippage is the difference between the expected price and the executed price. It occurs due to price movement between quote and execution. 

**You can configure slippage** in the Trading Panel by clicking the ⚙️ gear icon:
- Presets: 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%
- Custom: Any value from 0.1% to 50%
- Default: 2.5% (higher due to lower liquidity of tokenized stocks)

### Why did my swap fail?

Common reasons:

1. **Insufficient balance** - Not enough SOL for gas or tokens for swap
2. **Slippage too low** - Price moved more than your tolerance. Try increasing slippage (click ⚙️)
3. **Network congestion** - Try again or increase priority fee

## Favorites

### How do I add a stock to favorites?

Click the star icon (⭐) next to any stock in the list. Favorites are:

- Shown at the top of the stock list
- Highlighted with a golden border
- Saved to your wallet (no authentication required!)

### Why don't favorites need authentication?

Unlike trade history, favorites don't require proving wallet ownership. They're simply associated with your wallet address for convenience.

## Portfolio

### How do I see my holdings?

Connect your wallet and click "Portfolio" in the navigation. Your tokenized stock holdings will be automatically detected.

### Why don't I see my tokens?

Ensure:

1. You're connected with the correct wallet
2. The tokens are in your main wallet (not a token account)
3. The token has liquidity on Jupiter

### Can I import from other wallets?

Currently, Noreva shows holdings only for your connected wallet. Multi-wallet support is planned.

### Where is my trade history?

Your trade history is shown in the Portfolio page below your holdings. All trades made through Noreva are automatically saved.

## Account

### Do I need to create an account?

No traditional account is needed. Your Solana wallet IS your account. When you first connect and authenticate, a profile is automatically created.

### How does authentication work?

Noreva uses wallet signature authentication:

1. You sign a message with your wallet (free, not a transaction)
2. The signature proves you own the wallet
3. You're authenticated for 24 hours

### Where is my data stored?

Your profile and trade history are stored in a secure database with Row Level Security. Only you can access your own data.

## Security

### Is Noreva safe?

Noreva is a non-custodial application:

- We **never** have access to your private keys
- We **never** store your funds
- All swaps happen directly on-chain via Jupiter

### Do I need to approve tokens?

No. Unlike EVM chains, Solana doesn't require token approvals. You maintain full custody at all times.

### What wallets are supported?

- Phantom (recommended)
- Solflare
- Other Solana wallets via Wallet Adapter

## Technical

### What blockchain is this on?

Solana Mainnet. Noreva uses Helius RPC for reliable blockchain access.

### Is there an API?

Noreva does not offer a public API. Use the web interface for trading.
