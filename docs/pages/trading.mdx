Learn how to trade tokenized stocks on Noreva.

## Understanding Spreads

The **spread** is the difference between the tokenized stock price and the underlying stock price:

- **Positive spread (Premium)** - Token trades above stock price
- **Negative spread (Discount)** - Token trades below stock price

```
Spread = ((Token Price - Stock Price) / Stock Price) × 100%
```

### Example

If bAAPL trades at $182.50 and AAPL stock is at $180.00:

```
Spread = ((182.50 - 180.00) / 180.00) × 100% = +1.39% premium
```

## Trading via Jupiter

Noreva uses [Jupiter](https://jup.ag) - Solana's leading DEX aggregator - for all swaps. This ensures:

- **Best prices** across all Solana DEXs
- **Low slippage** through smart routing
- **Fast execution** on Solana's high-speed network

## Slippage Settings

Default slippage is set to **0.5%**. For volatile markets or large trades, you may need to increase this.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Higher slippage increases the chance of your trade executing but may result in a worse price.
