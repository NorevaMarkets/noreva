Learn how to trade tokenized stocks on Noreva.

## Understanding Spreads

The **spread** is the difference between the tokenized stock price and the underlying stock price:

- **Positive spread (Premium)** - Token trades above stock price
- **Negative spread (Discount)** - Token trades below stock price

```
Spread = ((Token Price - Stock Price) / Stock Price) × 100%
```

### Example

If AAPLx trades at $182.50 and AAPL stock is at $180.00:

```
Spread = ((182.50 - 180.00) / 180.00) × 100% = +1.39% premium
```

## Slippage Settings

Default slippage is set to **2.5%** for tokenized stocks. This is higher than typical DEX trades because:

- Tokenized stocks have lower liquidity than major tokens
- Price can move between quote and execution
- Higher slippage improves success rate

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Higher slippage increases the chance of your trade executing but may result in a worse price.
