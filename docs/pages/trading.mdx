## Trading Terminal

## Understanding Spreads

The **spread** is the difference between the tokenized stock price and the underlying stock price:

- **Positive spread (Premium)** - Token trades above stock price
- **Negative spread (Discount)** - Token trades below stock price

```
Spread = ((Token Price - Stock Price) / Stock Price) × 100%
```

### Example

If AAPLx trades at $182.50 and AAPL stock is at $180.00:

```
Spread = ((182.50 - 180.00) / 180.00) × 100% = +1.39% premium
```

## Slippage Settings

Slippage tolerance is now **fully configurable** in the Trading Panel:

### How to Set Slippage

1. Look for the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "Swap" in the Trading Panel
2. Click to open the slippage settings dropdown
3. Choose a preset: **0.5%**, **1%**, **2.5%**, or **5%**
4. Or enter a custom value (0.1% - 50%)

### Default: 2.5%

The default slippage is set to **2.5%** for tokenized stocks. This is higher than typical DEX trades because:

- Tokenized stocks have lower liquidity than major tokens
- Price can move between quote and execution
- Higher slippage improves success rate

### Warnings

- **Low slippage (`<0.5%`)** - May cause transaction failure due to price movement
- **High slippage (`>5%`)** - You may receive significantly less than quoted

> 💡 **Tip:** Start with 2.5% default. If transactions fail, try increasing slippage. For large trades, consider higher slippage.
